### Project Vision

**What problem are you solving?**

Many software engineering candidates find it difficult to practice real interview scenarios effectively. They lack personalized feedback, structured study plans, and real-time coding environments that mimic actual interviews.

**Who’s it for?**

This platform is designed for software engineers at all levels—from entry-level to experienced professionals—who want to prepare thoroughly for technical interviews and improve their coding, system design, and communication skills.

**How will it work?**

Users will engage with AI-powered mock interviews, solve coding challenges with instant AI feedback, and receive personalized recommendations based on their strengths and weaknesses. The platform will offer scheduling for live or AI-driven interviews, plus a code editor embedded in the browser.
